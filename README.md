# Vuency  

> Gain complete control and transparency over the execution of concurrent and asynchronous operations, with almost no code. (*Inspired by [ember-concurrency](https://github.com/machty/ember-concurrency)*)

# ðŸš§ Under active development.

## Installation

First, install the npm package:

`npm install vuency --save`

Then, install Vuency globally so that it becomes available to all component instances:

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import Vuency from 'vuency'

Vue.use(Vuency)
```

## Why Vuency?

Vuency helps you manage complex, event-driven operations with minimal code.

The two main benefits are:

* **Implicit state**: The operation's state is baked in, so that you don't have to manually set `isRunning` flags yourself, to handle common UI interactions.

* **Flow control**: Scheduling and cancellation for every instance of the operation is baked in, so you can easily manage the flow of repeat requests without the need for hacky `setTimeout` solutions, as well as manually cancel an operation at any moment.

The additional benefits:

* **Callback subscriptions**: Subscribe to callbacks that are called based on the stage or result of the operation, e.g. `beforeStart` or `onCancel`. This semantically separates the handling of corner cases from the core logic, which makes your code easier to reason about.

* **Bind data**: Bind specific parameters or options to the `nth` call of the instance, e.g. using `nth(1, { keepRunning: true })`, so that you can simulate an infinite loop without overpowering the main thread.

* **Async helpers**: Common async utilities, such as `timeout` helpers, that are automatically cleanup when the operation is over, which ensures that UI interactions flow with minimal latency.

* **Vue helpers**: Vue `watchers` and `events` are wrapped as additional modifiers, e.g. `runWith` for watchers, so that all logic for the operation can be nicely encapsulated together.

If that isn't enough, Vuency's API strikes a nice balance between declarative and imperative styles of programming, which makes complex code simple and fun to write.

3. Registering the task so that Vuency can inject it into the component instance.

### Registering a task

To allow you to easily register tasks, Vuency mixes the `tasks` property into each component instance.

Similar to Vue's `data` property, the tasks property must be declared as function, so that Vuency can inject a fresh copy of the  registered tasks into each component instance.

Also, for you're convenience, Vuency passes the the task factory function as the first argument to `tasks` so that you don't have to manually import it every time. Since you'll likely be using this function a lot, the convention is to abbreviate this function to `t`.

<p class="danger">
  All registered tasks must be named, either as named functions or named objects.
</p>


```js
// if registering only one task, then you can return the named function
export default {
  Tasks(t) {
    return t(function * myTask() {...})
  }
}

// if your registering one or more tasks, then return the named objects
export default {
  Tasks(t) {
    return {
      myTask: t(function * () {...}),
      myOtherTask: t(function * () {...})
    }
  }
}
```

If you like brevity, you can also use ES6 arrow syntax:

<p class="danger">
  Keep in mind that if you use ES6 arrow syntax for `tasks` property function,
  then the component's `this` context will only be available inside the task's function.
</p>

```js
// registering only one task, then return the named function
export default {
  Tasks: t => t(function * myTask() {...})
}

// registering one or more tasks, then return the named objects
export default {
  Tasks: (t) => ({
    myTask: t(function * () {...}),
    myOtherTask: t(function * () {...})
  })
}
```

Then, when the component is created, Vuency will iterate through the list of returned task objects and inject each one (by the function or objects name) into the component instance.
